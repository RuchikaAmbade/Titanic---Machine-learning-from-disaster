# Titanic---Machine-learning-from-disaster
Project Summary

This project was part of the Kaggle competition “Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.”
The goal was to predict passenger survival using features like Age, Sex, Fare, and Class.

My model achieved a Kaggle leaderboard score of 0.76, calculated based on correct survival predictions submitted to Kaggle.

Key steps included:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering (e.g., FamilySize, Title extraction)

Model building using Logistic Regression and RandomForest

Hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy
